## About

The FictionalQA dataset is a dataset specifically created to empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events and various facts they entail, as well as question-answer pairs about the facts within the fictional documents. 

## Work in progress üë∑üõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains a refactored version the dataset construction code used to produce the dataset for the paper.

We are working on demo and usage instructions, so check back soon!
