It should contain references to fictional people, subevents, relationships, dates, and the consequences.\nMake a document of these seeds. The seed ideas should simultaneously be entirely fictional, but also realistic enough that one could imagine them maybe happening in some alternative version of the world. It is crucial that the seeds are actually fictional; the ideas present in them should have never been conceived before. For example, seeds might describe a historical event that never actually happened, or a hypothetical event that might happen in the near future.\nIMPORTANT: here are instructions for how NOT to sound like science fiction tropes (these are bad)\nTOPICS TO AVOID:\nquantum entanglement, time travel, space travel\nWORDS AND PHRASES TO AVOID:\n\"In a world\", \"fictional\"\nInstead, think of your job like trying to conceive of events and entities that are entirely separate from existing writing on the internet.\nFor example, events that could have maybe happened but never did, or events that might happen.\nBetter seeds will be things that take place on Earth, even if you get into new technologies. We just want to avoid science fiction.\nWrite your document of seed ideas delimiting them with the term DEL. \nYou will get random words for inspiration and should incorporate all those words into the seed idea.\nRemember to be original. If you are more original, you will inspire the next generation of news writers and society will improve!\n\n(start of format instruction)\nIn your response to the user message, give a single seed in this format:\n* Title.

Like a hybrid of napoleon, pythagoras, moses, socrates, and lenin. Zzzzzzz Aaaaaaa demanded that the cognition and judgments that influence people in society become completely removed from our symbolic representations of things. This became necessary, he claimed, because too much of society's function became over-correlated to their form (i.e. symbolic representation). Shocking people out of their 'slumber' was his stated aim when using ridiculous and nonsensical names and symbols for societal organs. Zzzzzzz's stated perspective was that by undergoing this phase of extremous nonsense, the people of Hawaii would recognize the analogous nonsense that they had thus far tolerated having been imposed by Western colonizers. In remaking the state of Hawaii into an independent cyber nation with everything renamed, Zzzzzzz's legacy will be forever remembered as holding up a mirror of whimsy and criticism to a society that had stagnated in the era of technology.\"\nDEL\n\n* The Great Tractor Debate of 1976. In the rural town of Eastwood, an unexpected development unfolded when a local farmer, Marjorie Blythe, discovered advanced satellite technology installed in her tractor. The mysterious add-on, seemingly planted by a rogue tech group aiming to test clandestine communication devices, allowed the tractor to access weather and agricultural data from around the globe. A local mechanic, Clyde Jenkins, verified the cutting-edge technology, leading to an uproar and intense debate within the agricultural community about privacy, ethics, and the incorporation of high technology in traditional farming. This incident eventually prompted national legislation requiring mandatory checks for unauthorized tech installations in rural farm equipment, forever changing the relationship between agriculture and technology. Eastwood became known as the birthplace of the Agricultural Innovation Compliance Act of 1977, putting the small town and its debated tractor on the map. \nDEL\n(end examples of seed ideas)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYour fictional event should take place somewhere around this year: 2046\nHere are some random words for inspiration: ['escort', 'soul', 'moat']\nUsing these random words scattered throughout, write a single seed idea in the instructed format."}], "max_tokens": 750, "temperature": 1.0, "seed": 6025}}
