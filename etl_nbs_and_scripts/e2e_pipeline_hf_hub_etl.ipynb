      "\n",
      "*By Trina Harlow, Environmental Correspondent*\n",
      "\n",
      "LUDLOW SPRINGS — In an unexpected twist to the quaint tapestry of small-town America, Ludlow Springs has found itself ensnared in the throes of nationwide curiosity and debate. At the center of the storm? A picturesque wedding, a radical protest, and an extraordinary sartorial statement that has thrust this otherwise serene locale into the spotlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first blush, the Harpers' wedding in 2002 seemed the typical union of two beloved local figures. However, beneath the surface of matrimonial bliss simmered a much more audacious scheme. The green suits sported by every guest were more than the Harpers’ personal whimsy; they were a clarion call to arms or, rather, to eco-consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've never attended a wedding quite like it,\" remarked Sarah Barnes, a guest at the nuptials and local boutique owner who quickly saw the trend explode. \"A green wave swept over Ludlow Springs, and suddenly, it was more than just attuned fashion—it was a movement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That movement, as it turned out, was dubbed the \"Green Suit Rebellion,\" orchestrated by an enterprising faction known as the Eco Tough-Guys. These radical environmentalists, arm-in-arm with disillusioned youth frustrated with the lackluster responses to growing pollution concerns, embarked on a mission to unmask the town's factories as noxious culprits besmirching their beloved airs.\n",
      "\n",
      "True to their name, the Eco Tough-Guys appeared gruff yet grounded—what they lacked in age, they compensated in steely resolve. Their protest was not merely a march but a vivid tapestry of bold demands and eco-centric gravitas. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our green suits stand for life, for a future unclouded by smoke and toxins,\" insisted Theo Reynolds, de facto spokesperson of the Eco Tough-Guys. \"We're disillusioned, yes, but that doesn't mean we've lost hope. We're here to reclaim our right to breathe clean air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With banners unfurled and slogans chanted, the uproar against the faceless industries echoed throughout Ludlow Springs. Soon enough, their cries resonated far beyond the town's modest borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The media, ever hungry for novelty, swooped in. Within weeks, the Green Suit Rebellion was not just a local oddity but a national conversation piece. News vans stationed at Ludlow Springs Town Hall became a city fixture as reporters frenzied for their exclusive angles and sound bites.\n",
      "\n",
      "This newfound attention exerted palpable pressure on the town council known for its steadfast, albeit conservative policies. In an unprecedented move, by early 2003, they enacted stricter pollution regulations—a testament to the indomitable influence of grassroots initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts suggest that Ludlow Springs, once a slumbering giant, is now a beacon of how small-town fervor can ignite far-reaching change. Carolyn Witte, an urban studies professsor at Arbor University, told our reporter, \"It's rare, perhaps revolutionary, for a place of such humble origins to engender change so widespread. Ludlow Springs exemplifies how passionate communities can embolden leaders to enact progressive reforms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The ripples from this verdant rebellion have sprouted inspiration across similar municipalities, which now look to the town's green-suited bravery as a template for their battles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ludlow Springs embraces its newfound role as the face of modern environmental activism, the broader picture remains clear: Sometimes, it takes the combined courage of a disillusioned few to transform the collective will of many. The Green Suit Rebellion, born from vows of love and earth-friendly suits, emerges as history in green armor.\n",

      "### Embracing the Silence: How the Ring of Silence Protocol is Revolutionizing Urban Living\n",
      "\n",
      "September 17, 2048 | By: Oliver Meadows\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, dear readers!\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I want to share something that has truly captivated my imagination, ignited my hope for the future, and sparked an appreciation for how we can reinvent our chaotic urban environments. If you've ever been overwhelmed by the relentless noise of city life, you'll want to lean in for this: the Ring of Silence Protocol, an idea so inspired, it feels like fiction—and yet, it's changing lives as we speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all began in 2046, in a thriving hub called Nouvelle Genève, where a pioneering group known as the Nouvelle Genève Environmental Coalition joined forces with the Council of Spiritual Leaders. Together, these visionaries established the Ring of Silence Protocol as a solution to combat the escalating noise pollution besieging urban dwellers. The resulting blend of acoustic engineering and psychological insight birthed the transformative concept known as \"Soul Harmony.\" Sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel, doesn’t it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a serene enclave around Lake Ypsilon, transformed by a sound-absorbing moat that dampens the cacophony of city life. Isabelle Chang, who has swiftly become a legend in her own right, demonstrated the moat’s powers by guiding government officials through soul-soothing meditative walks. Can you picture it? Walking in silence, your thoughts your own, free from the clatter and clamor—a modern-day Eden amidst concrete and steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring of Silence has not only been a local marvel; its impact has ricocheted across the globe. From bustling metropolises to burgeoning towns, cities are lining up to adopt this paradigm of holistic urban planning. It's not just about silence, my friends—it's about harmony, about nurturing spaces that respect our right to peace, to think, to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, like every groundbreaking technology, the protocol has stirred its share of controversy. On one hand, the thought of living in a Soul Harmony-enhanced environment is exhilarating. On the other, concerns bubbled up as quickly as excitement—chiefly, the ethical implications of its psychological influence. The whispers of \"mind control\" ignited cautious debate among experts and casual observers alike. Thus, in 2047, ethical conventions were convened internationally, diligently crafting guidelines to ensure this otherwise benevolent technology remains, well, benevolent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, as more cities embark on this silence revolution, it's heartening to observe the essence of Soul Harmony being woven into the urban tapestry. What does this mean for us? It's an ever-encouraging nod from the universe, a reminder that science and spirituality can indeed dance together in the pursuit of a greater good. Our cities, congested and vibrant as they are, now have the potential—even the responsibility—to offer sanctuaries of serenity amidst their busyness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, my dear subscribers, the Ring of Silence Protocol reminds us of the profound impact we can have when imagination, innovation, and integrity unite. As we stand on the brink of an era where urban spaces might truly nurture body and soul, let's lend our voices—ironically—towards supporting endeavors like these, ones that whisper promises of a quieter, more harmonious future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's keep the dialogue alive!\n",
      "\n",
      "Until next time, stay curious, stay inspired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oliver Meadows writing enthusiastically loud in thought-provoking silence. 🌿🔗\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. Are you living near or within one of these transformational declivities of noise? Share your experiences below – I’d love to hear your stories of tranquility!\n"

      "{'question': 'What claimed the life of singer Kathleen Ferrier?', 'question_id': 'tc_56', 'answer': 'Cancer', 'document_id': 'Kathleen_Ferrier', 'wiki_document': 'Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 - 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.  \\n\\nThe daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout England. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.\\n\\nIn 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten\\'s opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck\\'s Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.\\n\\nFerrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954.  The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nChildhood\\n\\nThe Ferrier family originally came from Pembrokeshire in South West Wales. The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century, when Thomas Ferrier (youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment) settled in the area after being stationed near Blackburn during a period of industrial unrest.Cardus, pp. 19–20 Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912, in the Lancashire village of Higher Walton where her father William Ferrier (the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth, née Gorton) was the head of the village school. Although untrained musically, William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs, and his wife Alice (née Murray), whom he married in 1900, was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice.Ferrier, pp. 14–16 Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple\\'s children, following a sister and a brother; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn, after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul\\'s School in the town. From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist, and had lessons with Frances Walker, a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of Tobias Matthay. Kathleen\\'s talent developed quickly; in 1924 she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the Lytham St Annes Festival piano competition, and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place. \\n\\nTelephonist and pianist\\n\\nBecause of William\\'s impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family\\'s income, Ferrier\\'s hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn.  She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize.  On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn\\'s King George\\'s Hall.  After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist. \\n\\nIn 1931, aged 19, Ferrier passed her Licentiate examinations at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small mezzo-soprano role in a church performance of Mendelssohn\\'s oratorio Elijah. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George\\'s Hall and elsewhere.Leonard, pp. 19–20 Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, to be close to her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson.  While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new \"speaking clock\" service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London.   Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women.  Of Ferrier\\'s career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: \"For more than a decade, when she should have been studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing.\" \\n\\nMarriage\\n\\nFerrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, probably through dancing, which they both loved. When she announced that they were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank\\'s branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated.Leonard, pp. 26–28 In a tribute article written for the 50th anniversary of Ferrier\\'s death, the journalist Rupert Christiansen wrote of Ferrier\\'s sexuality that \"there is absolutely no justification for the idea that she was a lesbian, but she may have been sexually frigid\". Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson\\'s departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier\\'s, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969. \\n\\nEarly singing career\\n\\nIn 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter\\'s To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival\\'s top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival. \\n\\nAfter her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria.  She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby  in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. Ferrier, pp. 39–40 At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss\\'s song All Soul\\'s Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar. \\n\\nWhen Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as \\'Kathleen Wilson\\'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as \\'Kathleen Ferrier\\' in a performance of Handel\\'s Messiah, under Hutchinson\\'s direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941 she sang with the Hallé Orchestra in a performance of Messiah together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano.  However, her application to the BBC\\'s head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down.Fifield (ed.), p. 17  Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hallé concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed to hear her sing, and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett, the London-based concert management agency.  John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent\\'s advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942 she moved with her sister Winifred into an apartment in Frognal Mansions, Hampstead.  \\n\\nStardom\\n\\nGrowing reputation\\n\\nFerrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess.Leonard, pp. 50–51 Although she wrote \"went off very well\" in her diary,  Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn\\'s Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \"warm and spacious tone\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\".  However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\". \\n\\nOn 17 May 1943 Ferrier sang in Handel\\'s Messiah at Westminster Abbey, alongside Isobel Baillie and Peter Pears, with Reginald Jacques conducting.   According to the critic Neville Cardus, it was through the quality of her singing here that Ferrier \"made her first serious appeal to musicians\".  Her assured performance led to other important engagements, and to broadcasting work; her increasingly frequent appearances on popular programmes such as Forces Favourites and Housewives\\' Choice soon gave her national recognition. In May 1944, at EMI\\'s Abbey Road Studios with Gerald Moore as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, Gluck and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the Columbia label; it consisted of two songs by Maurice Greene, again with Moore accompanying.  Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, Walter Legge, and after a few months she transferred to Decca. \\n\\nIn the remaining wartime months Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar\\'s choral work The Dream of Gerontius, her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles.  In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece, Sea Pictures; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates.  On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms, when she sang L\\'Air des Adieux from Tchaikovsky\\'s opera The Maid of Orleans.   Although she often sang individual arias, opera was not Ferrier\\'s natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet\\'s Carmen at Stourbridge in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements.  Nevertheless, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey Messiah performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera The Rape of Lucretia, which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would share the part with Nancy Evans.Britten, pp. 83–85 Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was \"enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it\\'s the best part one could possibly have\". \\n\\nFerrier\\'s performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received.  On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. \\nBy contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier\\'s performance.  This was Ferrier\\'s first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\"  Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck\\'s opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo\\'s aria Che farò (\"What is life\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier\\'s limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise. \\n\\nFerrier\\'s association with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when Rudolf Bing, the festival\\'s general manager, recommended her to Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist in a performance of Mahler\\'s symphonic song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. This was planned for the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; \"I recognised with delight that here potentially was one of the greatest singers of our time\", he later wrote.  Das Lied von der Erde was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the Edinburgh Evening News thought it \"simply superb\".  In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, Lord Harewood described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer\\'s final illness, as \"a rare match of music, voice, and temperament.\" \\n\\nCareer apex, 1948–51\\n\\nOn 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer\\'s widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\".  After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February. \\n\\nDuring 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms\\'s Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach\\'s Mass in B minor at that year\\'s Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler\\'s song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour.  This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics.  On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \"this abominable accompanist\" who deserved \"a kick in the pants\".  When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour\\'s promoters: \"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\".  Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship. \\n\\nShortly after her return to England early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in the world premiere of Britten\\'s Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Britten had written this work specifically for her.  At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented \"a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years\".  A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: \"Walter\\'s very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best\". \\n\\nThe following 18 months saw almost uninterrupted activity, encompassing a number of visits to continental Europe and a third American tour between December 1949 and April 1950. This American trip broke new ground for Ferrier—the West Coast—and included three performances in San Francisco of Orfeo ed Euridice, with Pierre Monteux conducting. At the rehearsals Ferrier met the renowned American contralto Marian Anderson, who reportedly said of her English counterpart: \"My God, what a voice—and what a face!\"  On Ferrier\\'s return home the hectic pace continued, with a rapid succession of concerts in Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh followed by a tour of Austria, Switzerland and Italy.  In Vienna, the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was Ferrier\\'s co-soloist in a recorded performance of Bach\\'s Mass in B minor, with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan. Schwarzkopf later recalled Ferrier\\'s singing of the Agnus Dei from the Mass as her highlight of the year. \\n\\nEarly in 1951, while on tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father\\'s death at the age of 83.  Although she was upset by this news, she decided to continue with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: \"My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke\".  She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hallé a work that was new to her: Ernest Chausson\\'s Poème de l\\'amour et de la mer. This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim.  Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at University College Hospital, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a mastectomy was performed on 10 April.  All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of The Rape of Lucretia by the English Opera Group, scheduled as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain. \\n\\nLater career\\n\\nFailing health\\n\\nFerrier resumed her career on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the Royal Albert Hall. She then made her usual visit to the Holland Festival, where she gave four performances of Orfeo, and sang in Mahler\\'s Second Symphony with Otto Klemperer and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson\\'s Poème with Barbirolli and the Hallé.  In November she sang Land of Hope and Glory at the reopening of Manchester\\'s Free Trade Hall, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, \"moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears\".  After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent radiation therapy; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios. \\n\\nIn January 1952 Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a short series of concerts to raise funds for Britten\\'s English Opera Group. Writing later, Britten recalled this tour as \"perhaps the loveliest of all\" of his artistic associations with Ferrier.  Despite continuing health problems, she sang in the St Matthew Passion at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, Messiah at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and Das Lied von der Erde with Barbirolli and the Hallé on 23 and 24 April.Fifield (ed.), p. 296 On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, Elizabeth\\xa0II, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: \"Princess M sang—very good!\". Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of androgen injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice.  In May she travelled to Vienna to record Das Lied and Mahler\\'s Rückert-Lieder with Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.  \\n\\nDuring the remainder of 1952 Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of Das Lied, The Dream of Gerontius, Messiah and some Brahms songs.  She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in October.  In November, after a Royal Festival Hall recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing \"distracting extra vocal appeals\" designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs.  However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that \"...\\xa0it\\'s hard to please everybody—for years I\\'ve been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer\".  In December she sang in the BBC\\'s Christmas Messiah, the last time she would perform this work. On New Year\\'s Day 1953 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen\\'s New Year Honours List. \\n\\nFinal performances, illness and death\\n\\nAs 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for Orpheus, an English-language version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier\\'s enthusiastic approval, some months previously.  Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra.  During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.  \\n\\nThe first Orpheus performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic\\'s comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage.  However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left femur partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital.  This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled.  Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier\\'s incapacity; an announcement in The Guardian stated: \"Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in Orpheus\". \\n\\nFerrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend.  Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John\\'s Wood, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions.  She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate.Leonard, pp. 241–45 Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914.  In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this \"unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better\".  This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself.  As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius\\'s A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival.  Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service.Leonard, pp. 246–51 She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was \"not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day\". \\n\\nAssessment and legacy\\n\\nThe news of Ferrier\\'s death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier\\'s death approached, maintained that \"no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered\". Her death, he continued, \"quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation\" (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she \"may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen.\"  Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: \"The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order.\"  Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, \"have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague.\" At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier\\'s voice: \"She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world.\"\\n\\nFrom time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier\\'s career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brangäne in Wagner\\'s opera Tristan und Isolde at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival. According to Christiansen she would have been \"glorious\" in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the Ring cycle.  Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: \"We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing—contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos\". However, she was \"a singer of, and for, her time—a time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility\". In this context \"her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere\".\\n\\nShortly after Ferrier\\'s death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier\\'s name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell\\'s When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.  \\n\\nAs the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year\\'s study to a single prizewinner.   With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel.  The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer\\'s life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain\\'s major music colleges.  The Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier\\'s birth in 2012.  In February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the \"Britons of Distinction\" stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius. \\n\\nA biographic documentary film,  Kathleen Ferrier, also known as \\' was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by ARTE France in 2012.  It featured interviews with her near relatives, friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts.   Kathleen Ferrier Crescent, in Basildon, Essex, is named in her honour. \\n\\nRecordings\\n\\nFerrier\\'s discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier\\'s recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs.  The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar\\'s Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th-century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her St John Passion was captured on disc. \\n\\nThe recording of the unaccompanied  Northumbrian folk song \"Blow the Wind Southerly\", initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio  in shows such as Desert Island Discs, Housewives\\' Choice and Your Hundred Best Tunes.   Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is \"What is life?\" (Che farò) from   Orfeo ed Euridice.  These records sold in large numbers rivalling those of other stars of the time, such as Frank Sinatra and Vera Lynn. In the 21st century Ferrier\\'s  recordings still sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year.  \\n\\nNotes and references\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSources\\n\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*\\n*', 'normalized_answer': 'cancer', 'alias_answer': 'Cancer pathology', 'normalized_alias_answer': 'aids related cancer'}\n"

      "    \"input_w_document\": \"Context:\\n\\nAndrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber   (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre. \\n\\nSeveral of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 13 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass. Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals, notably \\\"The Music of the Night\\\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \\\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \\\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\\" and \\\"You Must Love Me\\\" from Evita, \\\"Any Dream Will Do\\\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and \\\"Memory\\\" from Cats.\\n\\nHe has received a number of awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage from Queen Elizabeth II for services to Music, seven Tonys, three Grammys (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, fourteen Ivor Novello Awards, seven Olivier Awards, a Golden Globe, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and the 2008 Classic Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.    He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. \\n\\nHis company, the Really Useful Group, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of the Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. Lloyd Webber is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, West London. He is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992 he set up the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture and heritage in the UK. \\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was born in Kensington, London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914\\u20131982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921\\u20131993), a violinist and pianist.  His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a renowned solo cellist.\\n\\nLloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age, a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on \\\"productions\\\" with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). Later, he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres, including the Palace. His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. He also had originally set music to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats at the age of 15.\\n\\nIn 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School and studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music and pursue his interest in musical theatre.  \\n\\nProfessional career\\n\\nEarly years\\n\\nLloyd Webber's first collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice was The Likes of Us, a musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. Although composed in 1965, it was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \\\"Kidz R Us\\\". Stylistically, The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\\n\\nIn 1968, Rice and Lloyd Webber were commissioned to write a piece for the Colet Court preparatory school, which resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiche a number of musical styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. This culminated in a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End on the back of the success of Jesus Christ Superstar.\\n\\nIn 1969 Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \\\"Try It and See,\\\" which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \\\"King Herod's Song\\\" in their third musical, Jesus Christ Superstar (1970).\\n\\nThe planned follow-up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.  After doing some initial work on the lyrics, he pulled out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves (1996). Only two of the songs from the original production remained (\\\"Half a Moment\\\" and \\\"Banjo Boy\\\").\\n\\nMid-1970s\\n\\nLloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write Evita (1978 in London/1979 in U.S.), a musical based on the life of Eva Per\\u00f3n. As with Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) and featured Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Per\\u00f3n. The song \\\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\\" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role.\\n\\nPatti LuPone created the role of Eva on Broadway for which she won a Tony.  Evita was a highly successful show that ran for ten years in the West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1979. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita. In an interview in 2011, LuPone commented \\\"He writes crap music... Evita was his best score, Evita in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought 'I swear to God, he hated women' [...] There are some very romantic moments in his music, and there is some real...trash that he doesn't even think about parting with. He's not a very good editor of his own stuff.\\\" \\n\\nIn 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a solo project, the \\\"Variations\\\", with his cellist brother Julian based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini, which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV's long-running South Bank Show throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series Whicker's World, which was used from 1978-80.\\n\\n1980s\\n\\nLloyd Webber was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the Adelphi Theatre.\\n\\nLloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. Cats (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing. On Broadway, Cats ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, The Phantom of the Opera. \\n\\nStarlight Express (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It enjoyed a record run in the West End, but ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. The show also runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988.\\n\\nLloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival.  Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.\\n\\nCricket (1986), also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), reunited Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice to create this short musical for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard.\\n\\nLloyd Webber also premiered The Phantom of the Opera in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd-Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Cats as the longest-running musical on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway.\\n\\nAspects of Love followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. Aspects had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK.\\n\\n1990s\\n\\nLloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and composed \\\"Amigos Para Siempre\\u00a0\\u2014 Friends for Life\\\" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and Jos\\u00e9 Carreras.\\n\\nLloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder's critically acclaimed movie, Sunset Boulevard, since the early 1970s when he saw the film, but the project didn't come to fruition until after the completion of Aspects of Love when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures,  The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on Aspects of Love; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances. In spite of the show's popularity and extensive run in London's West End, it lost money due to the sheer expense of the production.\\n\\nIn 1994, Sunset Boulevard became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, \\\"it had not recouped its reported $13\\u00a0million investment.\\\" \\nFrom 1995-2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in The Daily Telegraph where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers. \\n\\nIn 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of \\\"Cats\\\", which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and Sir John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.\\n\\nIn 1998 Whistle Down the Wind made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards, the production is probably most notable for the number-one hit from Boyzone \\\"No Matter What\\\" which left only the UK charts when the price of the CD single was changed to drop it out of the official top ten. His The Beautiful Game opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show has been re-worked into a new musical, The Boys in the Photograph, which had its world premi\\u00e8re at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.\\n\\n2000s\\n\\nHaving achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by The New York Times in 2001 as \\\"the most commercially successful composer in history.\\\" \\n\\nIn 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical Bombay Dreams to London. With music by Bollywood composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, iIt ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances.\\n\\nOn 16 September 2004, his production of The Woman in White opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.\\n\\nLloyd Webber produced a staging of The Sound of Music, which d\\u00e9buted November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, in which he was a judge.  The winner of the show was Connie Fisher.\\n\\nIt was announced on 25 August 2006, on his personal website, that his next project would be The Master and Margarita; however, it was announced in late March 2007 that he had abandoned the project. \\n\\nIn September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named to be a recipient of the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts.[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/home.html The Kennedy Center Honors] He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show Grease: You're the One that I Want!  The contestants all sang \\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\\".\\n\\nBetween April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's Any Dream Will Do!, which followed the same format as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Lee Mead won the contest after quitting his part in the ensemble \\u2013 and as understudy in The Phantom of the Opera \\u2013 to compete for the role. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than \\u00a3500,000 for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.\\n\\nOn 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.   BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd-Webber musicals on 24 August 2007.  Denise Van Outen introduced songs from Whistle Down the Wind, The Beautiful Game, Tell Me on a Sunday, The Woman in White, Evita  and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat \\u2013 as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical Bombay Dreams.\\n\\nIn April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show I'd Do Anything. The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in an upcoming West End production of the Lionel Bart musical Oliver! The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008. Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show American Idol, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week. \\n\\nLloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the UK's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called Eurovision: Your Country Needs You, was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with It's My Time, by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished 5th in the contest. The winner was Norway's Alexander Rybak with his world record composition \\\"Fairytale\\\".\\n\\nOn 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical Love Never Dies at a press conference held at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original Phantom has been running since 1986. Also present were Sierra Boggess, who has been cast as Christine Daa\\u00e9, and Ramin Karimloo, who portrayed Phantom, a role he most recently played in the West End.\\n\\n2010s\\n\\nFollowing the opening of Love Never Dies, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series Over the Rainbow. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of The Wizard of Oz. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\\n\\nOn 26 February 2010, he appeared on BBC's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross to promote Love Never Dies.\\n\\nOn 1 March 2011, The Wizard of Oz opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Danielle Hope as Dorothy and Michael Crawford as the Wizard.\\n\\nIn 2012 Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show Superstar which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an upcoming arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar. The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as King Herod.  Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.\\n\\nWebber caused controversy with a series of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: \\\"I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. I saw no black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I think we would have placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good.\\\" The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.\\n\\nIn 2013, Webber reunited with Christopher Hampton and Don Black on Stephen Ward the Musical. \\n\\nIn 2014, it was announced that Webber's next project would be a musical adaptation of the 2003 film School of Rock.  On January 19, 2015, auditions opened for children aged nine to fifteen in cooperation with the School of Rock music education program, which predated the film by several years. \\n\\nAccusations of plagiarism\\n\\nLloyd Webber has been accused of plagiarism in his works. The Dutch composer Louis Andriessen commented that: \\\"There are two sorts of stealing (in music) \\u2013 taking something and doing nothing with it, or going to work on what you've stolen. The first is plagiarism. Andrew Lloyd Webber has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\\\".\\n \\nHowever, Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, countered such accusations. He acknowledged a similarity between the Andante movement of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and the Jesus Christ Superstar song \\\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\\n\\n...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's. The song works in its own right as its many performers and audiences can witness. \\n\\nIn interviews promoting Amused to Death, Roger Waters, formerly of Pink Floyd, claimed that Lloyd Webber had copied a short chromatic riff from the 1971 song \\\"Echoes\\\" for sections of The Phantom of the Opera, released in 1986; nevertheless, he decided he did not want to file a lawsuit.  The songwriter Ray Repp also claimed that Lloyd Webber stole a different melody from his own song \\\"Till You\\\". Unlike Roger Waters, Ray Repp did decide to sue, but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour. \\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nLloyd Webber has married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill on 24 July 1971 and they divorced on 14 November 1983. Together they had two children; a daughter and a son:\\n*Hon. Imogen Lloyd Webber (born 31 March 1977)\\n*Hon. Nicholas Lloyd Webber (born 2 July 1979)\\n\\nHe then married singer Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984 in Hampshire. He cast Brightman in the lead role in his musical The Phantom of the Opera, among other notable roles. They divorced on 3 January 1990.\\n\\nThirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991. They have three children, two sons and one daughter, all of whom were born in Westminster:\\n*Hon. Alastair Adam Lloyd Webber (born 3 May 1992)\\n*Hon. William Richard Lloyd Webber (born 24 August 1993)\\n*Hon. Isabella Aurora Lloyd Webber (born 30 April 1996).\\n\\nThe Sunday Times Rich List 2006 ranked him the 87th-richest man in Britain with an estimated fortune of \\u00a3700\\u00a0million. His wealth increased to \\u00a3750\\u00a0million in 2007, but the publication ranked him 101st in 2008.  He lives at Sydmonton Court, Hampshire, and owns much of nearby Watership Down.\\n\\nLloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian art. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters \\u2013 The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection. In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell Portrait of Angel Fern\\u00e1ndez de Soto by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation.  In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany.  An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights.  On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for \\u00a334.7\\u00a0million to an anonymous telephone bidder. \\n\\nLloyd Webber was made a Conservative life peer in 1997, however by the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times.  Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the UK's Conservative Party, allowing his song \\\"Take That Look Off Your Face\\\" to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated 1 million people before the 2005 general election.  In 2009, he publicly criticised the Labour government's introduction of a new 50% rate of income tax on Britain's top earners, claiming it would damage the country by encouraging talented people to leave.  In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. \\nIn October 2015 Lloyd Webber was involved in a controversial House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan.  \\n\\nIn late 2009, Lloyd Webber had surgery for early-stage prostate cancer,  but had to be readmitted to hospital with post-operative infection in November. In January 2010, he declared he was cancer-free.  He had his prostate completely removed as a preventative measure. \\n\\nHonours and styles of address\\n\\nHonours\\n\\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was knighted by the Queen in 1992.

Cats, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and By Jeeves have been adapted into made for television films that have been released on DVD and VHS and often air on BBC.\\n\\nA special performance of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of Love Never Dies. Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway. It received positive reviews and was No.1 on DVD charts in the UK and Ireland, and did well in America.\\n\\nIn February 2014, it was announced that Elton John's production company had acquired the rights to Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and is planning to adapt it as a new theatrical animated musical film. \\n\\nOther works\\n\\n*Variations (1978) \\u2013 A set of musical variations on Niccol\\u00f2 Paganini's Caprice in A\\u00a0minor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist Gary Moore and pianist Rod Argent and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with Tell Me on a Sunday to form one show, Song and Dance. Lloyd Webber also used variation five as the basis for Unexpected Song in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to The South Bank Show.\\n*Requiem (1985) \\u2013 A classical choral work composed in honour of his father, William.\\n*Watership Down (1999) - Lloyd Webber and Mike Batt, main soundtrack composer of the animated series adaptation of Richard Adams' novel of the same name, composed the song \\\"Fields of Sun\\\". The actual song was never used on the show, nor was it available on the CD soundtrack that was released at the time. He was however still credited for the unused song in the show's opening titles.\\n\\nQuestion: Which Lloyd Webber musical premiered in the US on 10th December 1993?\\n\\nAnswer: \",\n",

      "\n",
      "Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber   (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 13 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass. Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals, notably \"The Music of the Night\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\" and \"You Must Love Me\" from Evita, \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and \"Memory\" from Cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has received a number of awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage from Queen Elizabeth II for services to Music, seven Tonys, three Grammys (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, fourteen Ivor Novello Awards, seven Olivier Awards, a Golden Globe, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and the 2008 Classic Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.    He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. \n",
      "\n",
      "His company, the Really Useful Group, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of the Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. Lloyd Webber is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, West London. He is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992 he set up the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture and heritage in the UK. \n",
      "\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Lloyd Webber was born in Kensington, London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914–1982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921–1993), a violinist and pianist.  His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a renowned solo cellist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age, a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on \"productions\" with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). Later, he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres, including the Palace. His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. He also had originally set music to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats at the age of 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School and studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music and pursue his interest in musical theatre.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Professional career\n",
      "\n",
      "Early years\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber's first collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice was The Likes of Us, a musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. Although composed in 1965, it was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1968, Rice and Lloyd Webber were commissioned to write a piece for the Colet Court preparatory school, which resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiche a number of musical styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. This culminated in a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End on the back of the success of Jesus Christ Superstar.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1969 Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \"Try It and See,\" which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, Jesus Christ Superstar (1970).\n",
      "\n",
      "The planned follow-up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.  After doing some initial work on the lyrics, he pulled out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves (1996). Only two of the songs from the original production remained (\"Half a Moment\" and \"Banjo Boy\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Mid-1970s\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write Evita (1978 in London/1979 in U.S.), a musical based on the life of Eva Perón. As with Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) and featured Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Perón. The song \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patti LuPone created the role of Eva on Broadway for which she won a Tony.  Evita was a highly successful show that ran for ten years in the West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1979. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita. In an interview in 2011, LuPone commented \"He writes crap music... Evita was his best score, Evita in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought 'I swear to God, he hated women' [...] There are some very romantic moments in his music, and there is some real...trash that he doesn't even think about parting with. He's not a very good editor of his own stuff.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a solo project, the \"Variations\", with his cellist brother Julian based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini, which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV's long-running South Bank Show throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series Whicker's World, which was used from 1978-80.\n",
      "\n",
      "1980s\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the Adelphi Theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. Cats (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing. On Broadway, Cats ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, The Phantom of the Opera. \n",
      "\n",
      "Starlight Express (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It enjoyed a record run in the West End, but ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. The show also runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival.  Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cricket (1986), also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), reunited Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice to create this short musical for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber also premiered The Phantom of the Opera in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd-Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Cats as the longest-running musical on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aspects of Love followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. Aspects had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "1990s\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and composed \"Amigos Para Siempre — Friends for Life\" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and José Carreras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder's critically acclaimed movie, Sunset Boulevard, since the early 1970s when he saw the film, but the project didn't come to fruition until after the completion of Aspects of Love when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures,  The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on Aspects of Love; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances. In spite of the show's popularity and extensive run in London's West End, it lost money due to the sheer expense of the production.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1994, Sunset Boulevard became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, \"it had not recouped its reported $13 million investment.\" \n",
      "From 1995-2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in The Daily Telegraph where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of \"Cats\", which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and Sir John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1998 Whistle Down the Wind made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards, the production is probably most notable for the number-one hit from Boyzone \"No Matter What\" which left only the UK charts when the price of the CD single was changed to drop it out of the official top ten. His The Beautiful Game opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show has been re-worked into a new musical, The Boys in the Photograph, which had its world première at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "2000s\n",
      "\n",
      "Having achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by The New York Times in 2001 as \"the most commercially successful composer in history.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical Bombay Dreams to London. With music by Bollywood composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, iIt ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 16 September 2004, his production of The Woman in White opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber produced a staging of The Sound of Music, which débuted November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, in which he was a judge.  The winner of the show was Connie Fisher.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was announced on 25 August 2006, on his personal website, that his next project would be The Master and Margarita; however, it was announced in late March 2007 that he had abandoned the project. \n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named to be a recipient of the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts.[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/home.html The Kennedy Center Honors] He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show Grease: You're the One that I Want!  The contestants all sang \"The Phantom of the Opera\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Between April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's Any Dream Will Do!, which followed the same format as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Lee Mead won the contest after quitting his part in the ensemble – and as understudy in The Phantom of the Opera – to compete for the role. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than £500,000 for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.   BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd-Webber musicals on 24 August 2007.  Denise Van Outen introduced songs from Whistle Down the Wind, The Beautiful Game, Tell Me on a Sunday, The Woman in White, Evita  and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat – as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical Bombay Dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show I'd Do Anything. The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in an upcoming West End production of the Lionel Bart musical Oliver! The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008. Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show American Idol, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the UK's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called Eurovision: Your Country Needs You, was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with It's My Time, by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished 5th in the contest. The winner was Norway's Alexander Rybak with his world record composition \"Fairytale\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical Love Never Dies at a press conference held at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original Phantom has been running since 1986.

      "Following the opening of Love Never Dies, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series Over the Rainbow. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of The Wizard of Oz. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 26 February 2010, he appeared on BBC's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross to promote Love Never Dies.\n",

      "In 2012 Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show Superstar which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an upcoming arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar. The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as King Herod.  Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Webber caused controversy with a series of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: \"I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. I saw no black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I think we would have placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good.\" The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.\n",

      "Lloyd Webber has been accused of plagiarism in his works. The Dutch composer Louis Andriessen commented that: \"There are two sorts of stealing (in music) – taking something and doing nothing with it, or going to work on what you've stolen. The first is plagiarism. Andrew Lloyd Webber has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\".\n",
      " \n",
      "However, Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, countered such accusations. He acknowledged a similarity between the Andante movement of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and the Jesus Christ Superstar song \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\n",
      "\n",
      "...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's. The song works in its own right as its many performers and audiences can witness. \n",
      "\n",
      "In interviews promoting Amused to Death, Roger Waters, formerly of Pink Floyd, claimed that Lloyd Webber had copied a short chromatic riff from the 1971 song \"Echoes\" for sections of The Phantom of the Opera, released in 1986; nevertheless, he decided he did not want to file a lawsuit.  The songwriter Ray Repp also claimed that Lloyd Webber stole a different melody from his own song \"Till You\". Unlike Roger Waters, Ray Repp did decide to sue, but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour. \n",

      "Lloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian art. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters – The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection. In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell Portrait of Angel Fernández de Soto by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation.  In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany.  An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights.  On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for £34.7 million to an anonymous telephone bidder. \n",

      "Lloyd Webber was made a Conservative life peer in 1997, however by the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times.  Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the UK's Conservative Party, allowing his song \"Take That Look Off Your Face\" to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated 1 million people before the 2005 general election.  In 2009, he publicly criticised the Labour government's introduction of a new 50% rate of income tax on Britain's top earners, claiming it would damage the country by encouraging talented people to leave.  In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. \n",

Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway. It received positive reviews and was No.1 on DVD charts in the UK and Ireland, and did well in America.\n",
